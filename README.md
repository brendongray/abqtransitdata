# ABQ Transit Data (Re)Analysis

## About this project

In spring 2020, I was an intern with the City of Albuquerque's transit department. I helped put together a [simple data visualzation](https://github.com/brendongray/abqtransitdata/blob/d8230b4e86ae78978cf955b7fcc09f8c92d44222/Transit%20Presenation.pdf) using data from the National Transit Database (NTD). I pulled the data together and produced the visualization in MS Excel and MS PowerPoint. This approach, ubiquitous as it may be, leaves a lot to be desired. First, the work I did was not replicable; managing data in Excel involves a mix of complex steps and procedures. Adding to this, Excel usually leaves no record of the steps taken, making finding errors all but impossible. Second, the manual approach required that the transit department return to the NTD, re-pull the files, and re-do the data visualzation. No good.

I decided to start this project to fix those two issue areas. I used R Markdown to create a [reproducible data visualization](https://brendongray.github.io/abqtransitdata/RevisedTransitAnalysis2019.html) suitable for quick internal evaluations that drive data-grounded insight. In this version, the work is entirely reproducible and error free (assuming the inital code is good). It also easily updates each year the NTD publishes its reports, with just one file download nessecary. 

This is the type of work that improves accuracy, efficency, and data usefullness. 

For what it's worth, I'm not affiliated with the city, and I'm sure there are a number of errors in this work product, all of which are attributable to me.
