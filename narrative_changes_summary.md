# ABQ Transit Data (Re)Analysis
## Narrative of changes

The initial project was assigned by my project supervisor with the condition to replicate a previous transit data summary. The design choices (like color scheme, layout, etc.) were taken from that original work product. In my re-creation, I tried to retain as much of the original as possible, hence the consistent (if bland) design.

Similarly, the sample of cities was chosen by my supervisor. I retained it for simplicity.

A nice feature of R Markdown is the ability to reference data in the text in real time. These _inline_ code chunks update corresponding to the same _variables_ that the graphics do, meaning they update automatically when a new data file is entered. This is useful for professional reports where the data might change as the analysis changes, and very, very valueable for producing readable, easy-to-make internal reports. I did my best to include inline code in this project.

Some minor differences between the original and the final came up, and I did my best to match the two. Some instances, however, I couldn't imitate. When appropriate, I omitted information from the re-analysis (to make sure I at least produced something).

Lastly, I decided to stray from the original when producing the last data viz. I used a seperate data viz software, Flourish, to make this visual really pop. I didn't really like my original idea, and thought this was an appropriate place to make an improvement.
